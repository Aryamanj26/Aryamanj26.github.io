title: 8-bit Processor Design Project
description: |
  Designed and implemented a custom 8-bit processor from the ground up as part of the CSE-141L course. Led the full hardware design cycle, including instruction set architecture (ISA) definition, RTL design in Verilog, pipelined datapath implementation, and testbench development. Focused on performance optimization, ALU design, and verification using simulation tools. Demonstrated strong skills in digital logic, computer architecture, and FPGA prototyping.
skills:
  - Verilog HDL
  - RTL Design
  - FPGA Prototyping
  - Computer Architecture
  - Pipelining
  - ALU Design
  - Testbench Development
  - Performance Optimization
  - Digital Logic
